* rename-after-movie-title
  This program renames a directory in that way, that it is compatible
  with the Kodi (XBMC) [[kodi][naming standard for movies]].

  In order to get the right title the program tries to find a [[NFO]] file
  in the directory.  In each NFO file found, the program searches for
  [[IMDB]] links.  If it finds a link, the program fetches the web page and
  searchs for a meta tag containing the movie title.

** Usage
   Put the executable anywhere on your system and run it with the
   option '-g'.

   : C:\> rename-after-movie-title -g

   This will create a registry file in the directory, where the
   executable has been stored.  Import the registry file.

   After that right-click a directory.  The context menu will contain
   a new entry called "Rename after movie title".

   The default is to search the directories recursively.  If you do
   not want this, you have to add the option -r=false.
