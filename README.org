* rename-after-movie-title
  This program renames a directory in that way, that it is compatible
  with the Kodi (XBMC) [[kodi][naming standard for movies]].

  In order to get the right title the program tries to find a [[NFO]] file
  in the directory.  In each NFO file found the program searchs for
  [[IMDB]] links.  If it finds a link the program fetches the web page and
  searchs for a meta tag containing the movie title.
